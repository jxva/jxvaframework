response.reset()和response.resetBuffer()

getResponse的getWriter()方法连续两次输出流到页面的时候，第二次的流会包括第一次的流，所以可以使用将response.reset或者resetBuffer的方法。

reset():
Clears any data that exists in the buffer as well as the status code and headers. If the response has been committed, this method throws an IllegalStateException.

resetBuffer():
Clears the content of the underlying buffer in the response without clearing headers or status code. If the response has been committed, this method throws an IllegalStateException.
